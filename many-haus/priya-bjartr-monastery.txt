Priya was actually in a good, focused mindset as she practiced some attacks on a training dummy. Just be a good girl who trains hard, and people will trust your process, she thought. Every once in a while, she looked around to see who else would come by to train, being wary of her surroundings, but sheâ€™d go back to what she was doing before just as quickly.

Bjartr was slashing away at a training dummy with a sword. He had noticed at least one other person nearby, but did not do anything to acknowledge her presence. At least for now. He was getting a little bored of just beating up something for that didn't move.

Oh! Another person who Priya could train with. Or, if she was lucky, she could plug that seminar she offered to help advertise for Professor Kyle. He didn't seem to notice her at all, so she'd need to grab his attention somehow.

She did it by stabbing his training dummy with her own sword. c:

Bjartr stabbed all the way through the dummy he was slashing away at and just glared at the person who so kindly interrupted him. 

"What." He spat out, hand still on the hilt of the sword. Bjartr slowly dragged the sword out, maintaining eye contact the entire time.

Priya maintained eye contact with her new training partner. :bowlstare: "Do you want to train?"

Bjartr hanged the sword out fully, pointing the blade towards Priya. Targets that moved were always more fun. "Your move." He commanded, stepping away to give them more space.
